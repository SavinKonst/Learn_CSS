        T.H.E. Cat was a US television action drama that aired on NBC Fridays
        from 9:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. during the 1966-1967 television season.[1]
        The series was co-sponsored by R.J. Reynolds (Winston) and Lever
        Brothers and was created by Harry Julian Fink. Robert Loggia starred as
        the title character, Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat.[1] The series preceded
        the 1968-1970 ABC television series It Takes a Thief, which was also
        about a cat burglar who uses his skills for good.
